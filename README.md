Basic singleplayer tictactoe game, user vs computer, but with 3 modes of difficulty: easy, hard and insane. Insane mode implements rudimentary artificial intelligence by blocking 
double-attack tricks from the user. Difficult but not impossible to win in insane mode; left some backdoors open to exploit, so it's not impossible.
